         <p><span class="caps">To receive constructive</span> â€” and effective â€” feedback, we simply need to ask for it.</p>

         <p>We often find ourselves in situations where feedback on our work isn't helpful. Perhaps it's too detailed too early, or maybe it's too extensive too&nbsp;late.</p>

         <p>How many times has a presentation, or even a project, been derailed because we didn't signal to our audience what we were showing them, and why, where our progress was, and what constructive comments we needed from them?</p>

         <p>When people don't have something significant to offer, or we don't tell them <em>what kind</em> of feedback we're seeking, they tend to search for anything at all to mentionâ€¦ usually with good intentions. This is where "can we change the blue..." tends to come from ðŸ˜©</p>

         <p>The psychology behind this is that people feel they're <em>expected</em> to comment.</p>

         <p>Sometimes it can be the <em>expectancy effect</em> â€” where a group's expectations about someone's behaviour influences that person's behaviour; at worst, it might be plain old <em>seagull management</em> â€” someone swoops in from nowhere, makes a lot of noise, dumps on everything, then flies off.</p>

         <p>We can use a straightforward technique to structure the feedback we request, and&nbsp;offer.</p>

         <h2>30% vs<small>.</small> 90% feedback</h2>

         <p>At the start of a briefing <i>/</i> presentation <i>/</i> critique <i>/</i> shareback <i>/</i> showcase <i class="footnote">*</i> â€” simply state which stage of progress the work is at, and ask for suitable&nbsp;comments.</p>
         <p class="footnote"><i><span class="asterisk">*</span> enter your preferred gathering of humans</i></p>

         <p>If it's 30% complete, ask for 30% feedback. If it's 90% complete, ask for&nbsp;90% feedback.</p>

         <h3>When youâ€™re 30% done<small>...</small></h3>

         <p>You have a rough idea, and you're still in the early days of figuring things&nbsp;out.</p>

         <p>When starting a piece of work we know the least about what it is we need to do. We're making decisions with the least possible information. The beginning of a project moves much faster than the last stretch, so request feedback early and often.</p>

         <p>At this point, you need feedback which confirms or corrects the direction. Comments on pixels or punctuation aren't helpful as everything can&nbsp;change.</p>

         <p>You're asking your audience: "<strong>Are we on the right&nbsp;track?</strong>".</p>

         <p>In terms of responses, seek:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>if it makes sense</li>
          <li>first impressions on the concept</li>
          <li>if it meets relevant customer and business needs</li>
          <li>suggestions for other people or teams to&nbsp;involve</li>
          <li>if everyone's aligned and in agreement</li>
          <li>any high-level insights</li>
          <li>challenges to scope</li>
          <li>proceed / abandon decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When you're 90% done<small>...</small></h3>

        <p>You're almost finished.</p>

        <p>Strategic or concept feedback has already happened, and many things are locked in. Everyone should be aligned <i class="footnote">*</i>, and what remains are finishing touches. That's not to say you launch something no matter what, or that you can't make last minute major changes; but this can be stressful and costly, and should be the exception to the rule.
        <p class="footnote"><i><span class="asterisk">*</span> a whole article in itself, another time</i></p>

        <p>At this point, you <em>do</em> want people to sweat every tiny detail.</p>

        <p>You're asking your audience: "<strong>Is there anything we've&nbsp;missed?</strong>".</p>

        <p>In terms of input, seek:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>typos and shoddy grammar</li>
          <li>jargon, complex, or excluding language</li>
          <li>inappropriate tone and emotion</li>
          <li>ambiguous messaging or focus</li>
          <li>confusing structure, syntax, or&nbsp;information</li>
          <li>layout and formatting glitches</li>
          <li>janky usability or interactions</li>
          <li>unclear calls-to-action</li>
          <li>visual inconsistencies; well... <em>any</em> inconsistencies, really</li>
          <li>performance issues</li>
          <li><a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-july-31" title="An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues">accessibility gaps</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>. . .</i></p>

        <p>When requesting input on your work, state how far along you are and what youâ€™d like feedback on. People respond positively to being given edges, and it'll help orient them how to be most effective.</p>

        <p>I enjoy the simplicity and contrast of&nbsp;30%&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;90%; <br />but you can also consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>5% feedback</b> â€” do we agree on the problem we think weâ€™re solving?</li>
          <li>30% feedback â€” are we on the right track?</li>
          <li><b>60% feedback</b> â€” is the solution sound, will we meet our goals?</li>
          <li>90% feedback â€” is there anything weâ€™ve missed?</li>
          <li><b>100% feedback</b> â€” what have we learnt, and will try differently next time?</li>
        </ul>
